# NEST — Network Environment for Swarm Testing

<img width="1280" height="640" alt="nest_social_preview_1280x640" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/0a64fce5-3b14-4c05-bf61-47379900a65b" />


**You have an agent protocol. NEST tells you whether it actually works.**

You wrote a payments scheme, an identity scheme, a coordination scheme, a
trust scheme — something a fleet of agents has to agree on. NEST is the
test rig: it spins up a swarm, plugs your protocol into a 12-layer agent
stack, runs them through a scenario (marketplace, auction, voting,
consensus, supply chain, reputation), and gives you a trace you can grep,
diff, and validate against properties you care about.

It is a **testing tool first**, a simulator second.

```bash
pip install "nest-core[plugins]"
nest run marketplace
```

That's the whole "hello world". No clone, no path, no setup.

## Install

```bash
pip install "nest-core[plugins]"
```

That brings in the reference implementations for all 12 layers, the CLI,
and the seven built-in scenarios. Optionally:

```bash
pip install "nest-core[llm]"        # adds nest-shell for Tier 2 (LLM) agents
pip install "nest-core[full]"       # plugins + llm
```

Verify:

```bash
nest doctor
```

You should see `7/7 checks passed`. If you don't, the message tells you
what's missing.

---

## The 60-second tour

You don't need to clone the repo. The seven reference scenarios ship
inside the wheel.

```bash
# What's in the box
nest scenarios list

# Run one
nest run marketplace

# Look at the trace
nest inspect ./traces/marketplace.jsonl

# Get a metrics report (HTML)
nest report ./traces/marketplace.jsonl -o report.html

# Open the interactive dashboard
nest dashboard ./traces/marketplace.jsonl
```

Every `nest run <name>` writes a JSONL trace to `./traces/<name>.jsonl`.
Same seed → byte-identical trace, every time.

> **Read this if `nest run scenarios/marketplace.yaml` errors out:** that
> command only works *inside a clone of this repo* — the `scenarios/`
> directory isn't installed by pip. Use `nest run marketplace` (a built-in
> name) or copy a built-in out to edit:
> `nest scenarios cp marketplace .`

---

## Test your own protocol

This is the loop NEST is for. You have a protocol; you want to know if
it survives 50 agents, a 5% message-drop rate, and a few Byzantine
peers.

### 1. Pick the layer your protocol slots into

```
transport · comms · identity · registry · auth · trust ·
payments · coordination · negotiation · memory · privacy · datafacts
```

Say you're testing a new **payments** scheme.

### 2. Implement the layer interface

```python
# my_payments/plugin.py
from nest_sdk import (
    Payments, AgentId, Money, PaymentRef, Receipt, Quote,
    ServiceRef, PaymentStatus,
)

class MyPaymentProtocol(Payments):
    async def quote(self, service: ServiceRef) -> Quote: ...
    async def pay(self, to: AgentId, amount: Money, ref: PaymentRef) -> Receipt: ...
    async def verify_payment(self, ref: PaymentRef) -> PaymentStatus: ...
    async def refund(self, ref: PaymentRef) -> None: ...
```

### 3. Register it as a plugin

```toml
# pyproject.toml
[project.entry-points."nest.plugins.payments"]
my_scheme = "my_payments.plugin:MyPaymentProtocol"
```

Install it: `pip install -e .`

### 4. Point a scenario at it

```bash
# Get a scenario you can edit
nest scenarios cp marketplace .

# In marketplace.yaml, change one line:
#   payments: prepaid_credits
# to:
#   payments: my_scheme
```

### 5. Run it and compare

```bash
nest run marketplace.yaml -o ./traces/with-prepaid.jsonl    # baseline
# edit marketplace.yaml to flip back to your scheme
nest run marketplace.yaml -o ./traces/with-mine.jsonl

nest report ./traces/with-prepaid.jsonl -o ./report-baseline.html
nest report ./traces/with-mine.jsonl    -o ./report-mine.html

# Or assert properties programmatically:
python -c "
from pathlib import Path
from nest_core.validators import validate_trace
for r in validate_trace(Path('traces/with-mine.jsonl'), 'marketplace'):
    print(('PASS' if r.passed else 'FAIL'), r.name, r.detail)
"
```

That's the whole loop. Pick a layer, plug in your implementation, point
a scenario at it, watch what changes in the trace, run validators
against the trace. Repeat with `failures.message_drop: 0.05`, with 10×
more agents, with a Byzantine fraction — the same flow.

You can do this for any of the 12 layers. Trust, coordination, identity,
auth — all of them follow the same recipe.

## Built-in scenarios

Each one stresses a different part of the stack. Open them with
`nest scenarios show <name>` or copy them out with `nest scenarios cp <name> .`.

| Scenario | Agents | What it stresses |
|---|---|---|
| `marketplace` | 50 buyers, 50 sellers | Payments · trust · registry · negotiation under bilateral price discovery. |
| `auction` | 1 auctioneer + 19 bidders | Coordination + multi-round messaging; "the highest bid wins" is checked as a property. |
| `voting` | 1 proposer + 1 coordinator + 18 voters | Simple majority. Properties: every vote counted, no double-voting, tally matches. |
| `consensus` | 1 leader + 19 followers | Quorum agreement (default 2/3). Not a full BFT — useful for testing quorum-shaped protocols. |
| `supply_chain` | 4 (supplier → manufacturer → distributor → retailer) | Multi-hop message reliability under drop / partition. |
| `reputation` | 16 honest + 4 malicious + 1 observer | Trust layer under adversarial agents that cheat probabilistically. |
| `shell_marketplace` | 3 buyers + 3 sellers (LLM-backed) | Same as marketplace but agents are LLM-driven via `nest-shell`. Non-deterministic (Tier 2). |

Failure injection is per-scenario, edit the YAML:

```yaml
failures:
  message_drop: 0.05               # 5% of messages dropped
  byzantine_agents: 0.10           # 10% of agents send garbled messages
  network_partition:
    groups: [["agent-0","agent-1"], ["agent-2","agent-3"]]
```

## The 12 layers

Every layer is a Python `Protocol` (structural typing). Plugins are
resolved by name via entry points or a built-in default.

| # | Layer | Interface | Default plugin |
|---|---|---|---|
|  1 | Transport     | `Transport`     | `in_memory` (in-process event queue; no network I/O) |
|  2 | Communication | `CommsProtocol` | `nest_native` (JSON envelope, base64 payload) |
|  3 | Identity      | `Identity`      | `did_key` (deterministic public-key signatures for simulation; not Ed25519) |
|  4 | Registry      | `Registry`      | `in_memory` (dict lookup, no persistence) |
|  5 | Auth          | `Auth`          | `jwt` (HMAC-SHA256 token; not RFC JWT) |
|  6 | Trust         | `Trust`         | `score_average` (running mean reputation; no Sybil resistance). Also bundled: `eigentrust` (transitive, Sybil-resistant). |
|  7 | Payments      | `Payments`      | `prepaid_credits` (in-memory ledger) |
|  8 | Coordination  | `Coordination`  | `contract_net` (FIPA: propose · bid · resolve · commit) |
|  9 | Negotiation   | `Negotiation`   | `alternating_offers` (Rubinstein, with patience discount) |
| 10 | Memory        | `Memory`        | `blackboard` (shared KV, subscribe, CAS) |
| 11 | Privacy       | `Privacy`       | `noop` (stub passthrough) |
| 12 | Data Facts    | `DataFacts`     | `datafacts_v1` (dataset publish · fetch · ACL) |

All defaults are **reference implementations for testing**, not
production-ready. That is the point: you replace the layer you care about
with your real implementation and use the rest as a host.

## Validators

`nest_core.validators` ships property checks for each scenario. They
read a JSONL trace and verify protocol-level invariants — not just
message counts.

```python
from pathlib import Path
from nest_core.validators import validate_trace

for r in validate_trace(Path("traces/auction.jsonl"), "auction"):
    print(f"{'PASS' if r.passed else 'FAIL'}: {r.name} — {r.detail}")
```

| Scenario | Validator checks |
|---|---|
| Auction | Winner has the highest bid; exactly one winner per item; every bidder is notified. |
| Voting | Announced tally matches the count; every vote counted; no double-voting. |
| Consensus | Committed rounds have ≥ 2/3 accepts; only proposed values committed; ≤ 1 commit per round. |
| Supply chain | Delivered goods trace through all four hops; no materials lost. |
| Reputation | Cheaters get bad reports; agents with score ≤ −3 are warned. |
| Marketplace | No double-sell (same product to two buyers); every buy answered; sold price matches the offer. |

> **Important.** Validators are property *checks*, not blessings of the
> bundled scenarios. They inspect trace evidence and can still only verify
> properties encoded in the trace. Treat a passing validator as a regression
> signal, not a proof of protocol correctness.

---

## Fidelity tiers

| Tier | Agent | Clock | Scale | Deterministic | Use case |
|---|---|---|---|---|---|
| **1** | State-machine (`StateMachineAgent`) | Logical event ordering — see below | 10,000+ | Yes | Protocol correctness, parameter sweeps, regression. |
| **2** *(experimental)* | LLM-backed (`ShellAgent`) — OpenAI / Anthropic / mock | Same as Tier 1 | 10–100 | No | Exploring emergent behavior of LM agents. Not for benchmarks. |

Tier 2 needs `pip install "nest-core[llm]"` and an API key in
`OPENAI_API_KEY` or `ANTHROPIC_API_KEY`. Use `agents.brain: shell` and
`agents.llm_provider: anthropic|openai|mock` in the scenario YAML.

---

## Determinism &amp; what the clock does

Two things to know that aren't obvious:

1. **Same seed → identical trace.** The master RNG is seeded once,
   derives a per-agent RNG and a separate failure-injection RNG, and
   replays exactly under the same seed. You can use that for regression
   benchmarks.
2. **The default transport is zero-latency.** The bundled `in_memory`
   transport delivers at `time = now`, so the virtual clock stays at
   `0.0` and `mean_latency` / `duration` will both be `0.0` in your
   trace. The event queue still orders events deterministically, so
   *correctness* tests are fine. Latency *numbers* become meaningful
   only when agents use `ctx.schedule(delay, ...)` or you write a
   transport plugin that introduces per-hop delay.

---

## Limitations

- **Reference plugins are deliberately simplified.** They're testing
  scaffolding, not production code. Deterministic simulation signatures,
  no-op privacy, in-memory ledger, etc.
- **Reference scenarios are minimal baselines.** They check whether
  agents *interact*, not whether a real implementation of the protocol
  *is correct*. That's what your plugin is for.
- **Single process.** No distributed execution.
- **In-memory transport only out of the box.** No TCP, gRPC, or HTTP
  yet.
- **Tier 2 is non-deterministic.** Don't use it for benchmarks.
